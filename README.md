# Indeed Job Postings Index UI ✨

This repository is a fork of [hiring-lab/job_postings_tracker](https://github.com/hiring-lab/job_postings_tracker/tree/master) which contains the data behind the Indeed Hiring Lab's Job Postings Index data product. 

## Overview

This fork introduces a user interface built with Python and Streamlit to visualize and interact with the Indeed Job Postings Index data.

- **Streamlit**: Utilized for creating the UI elements and managing the application’s layout and interactivity.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Altair**: Used for generating charts and graphs to visualize the job postings data effectively.

## Live Demo
